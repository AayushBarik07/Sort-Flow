# Sort Flow 🧮✨

The **Sort Flow** is a sorting algorithm visualizer built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work through animated bars and smooth transitions.

## 🚀 Project Phases

### 📌 Phase 1: Project Setup

- Initialized a new React project using Vite.
- Installed necessary dependencies:
  - `React`, `Tailwind CSS`
- Set up project structure with reusable components.
- Configured Tailwind for styling consistency.

### 🎨 Phase 2: UI Design

- Designed the visual structure of the bar chart.
- Created a responsive layout using Flexbox and Tailwind classes.
- Added a dark/light theme toggle (if applicable).
- Ensured mobile responsiveness and accessibility.

### 🧠 Phase 3: Algorithm Logic Implementation

- Implemented popular sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Separated logic into reusable utility functions.
- Ensured all algorithms work correctly on sample arrays.

### 🎬 Phase 4: Visualization & Animation

- Animated the sorting steps using:
  - Color changes
  - Height transitions
- Added delay between steps using `setTimeout` to simulate sorting progress.
- Provided clear visual cues for comparisons, swaps, and sorted positions.

### 🧰 Phase 5: Interactivity & Controls

- Added user controls:
  - Array size slider
  - Speed control
  - Shuffle button
  - Dropdown for algorithm selection
  - Start Sorting button
- Disabled controls during sorting to prevent conflict.

### 🧼 Phase 6: Optimization & Final Touches

- Refactored code for readability and scalability.
- Handled edge cases (e.g., sorting empty or single-element arrays).
- Added comments and cleaned up unused code.
- Deployed the project using GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify.
